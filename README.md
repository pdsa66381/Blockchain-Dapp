# Blockchain-Dapp

A simple Decentralized Application demo in blockchain, for a Train Operator. The operator is able to deploy a smart-contract already defined, and 9 users are able to pay trips using blockchain. 

The goal with this project was to understand blockchain technology and develop a simple application, defining the stack of the system, front-end, middleware and blockchain network.  

In this project, the front-end was developed by using Vue.js, a progressive framework for building user interfaces which is designed to be incrementally adoptable and reusable to the project.(https://vuejs.org/)

To interact with blockchain network, is necessary a middleware to deal with the requests and responses from the interface to the network. In this project the middleware used was Web3 library, which allow you to interact with a local or remote ethereum node. (https://web3js.readthedocs.io)

Finally, we used Ganache-cli, a personal blockchain for Ethereum development, to deploy contracts and test the application.(https://github.com/trufflesuite/ganache-cli)
